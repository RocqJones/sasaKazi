## Structure.
**MVVM(Model view viewmodel architecture)** - Software architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface (the view) â€“ be it via a markup language or GUI code.

## Features.
1. Real-Time Group Messaging (Discussion).
2. Blog Section.
3. Course Selection.
4. Classroom.

## Tools
* **Firebase:** authentication | database | Real-time messaging | Storage.
* **ViewModel:** *Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations*
* **LiveData:** *To build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.*
* Data Binding with binding adapters
* Navigation with the SafeArgs plugin
* **[Multidex support](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex):** Below is Multidex Process illustration.
  - `Dex` stands for **Dalvik Executable**, which is what Google's virtual machine processor (Dalvik) uses to handle Android Applications. MultiDex integration in Android Studio allows Android Developers the ***ability to compile and execute a code-base with over 65,536 methods!***.<br>

[Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-guide.html) - Coroutines are computer program components that *generalize subroutines for non-preemptive multitasking*, by allowing execution to be suspended and resumed. Coroutines are well-suited for implementing familiar program components such as *cooperative tasks, exceptions, event loops, iterators, infinite lists and pipes*.<br>
